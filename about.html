        <h3>background</h3>
        <p>You're the greatest thing that has ever been or ever will be. You're special. You're so very special. Trees live in your fan brush, but you have to scare them out. Let that brush dance around there and play. That's a son of a gun of a cloud. Pretend you're water. Just floating without any effort. Having a good day. I was blessed with a very steady hand; and it comes in very handy when you're doing these little delicate things.</p>
        <p>That's what makes life fun. That you can make these decisions. That you can create the world that you want. We can fix anything. There we go.</p>
        <h3>interests & hobbies</h3>

        <p>Let's make a happy little mountain now. It's a good way of getting rid of all your anxieties and hostilities. Nice little fluffy clouds laying around in the sky being lazy. There isn't a rule. You just practice and find out which way works best for you. In your imagination you can go anywhere you want. Steve wants reflections, so let's give him reflections.</p>
        <p>Nothing wrong with washing your brush. The little tiny Tim easels will let you down. Isn't it great to do something you can't fail at?</p>
        <h3>portland stuff i like</h3>
        <p>I get carried away with this brush cleaning. Just use the old one inch brush. That's the way I look when I get home late; black and blue.</p>

        <p>Let your imagination be your guide. Only God can make a tree - but you can paint one. Sometimes you learn more from your mistakes than you do from your masterpieces.</p>
        <p>We tell people sometimes: we're like drug dealers, come into town and get everybody absolutely addicted to painting. It doesn't take much to get you addicted. If you hypnotize it, it will go away. These things happen automatically. All you have to do is just let them happen. There it is. Go out on a limb - that's where the fruit is. This is gonna be a happy little seascape.</p>

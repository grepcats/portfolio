        <p>Just think about these things in your mind - then bring them into your world. The only thing worse than yellow snow is green snow. Don't be bashful drop me a line.</p>
        <p>That's a son of a gun of a cloud. Automatically, all of these beautiful, beautiful things will happen. It's hard to see things when you're too close. Take a step back and look.</p>
        <p>We don't want to set these clouds on fire. Everything is happy if you choose to make it that way. We'll make some happy little bushes here. Put your feelings into it, your heart, it's your world.</p>
        <p>Imagination is the key to painting. Even trees need a friend. We all need friends. We'll play with clouds today. The secret to doing anything is believing that you can do it. Anything that you believe you can do strong enough, you can do. Anything. As long as you believe. We don't have to be committed. We are just playing here.</p>
